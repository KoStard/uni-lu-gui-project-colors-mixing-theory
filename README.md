# uni-lu-gui-project-colors-mixing-theory
A university project - GUI University of Luxembourg - color mixing theory.

You get to choose between additive and subtractive ways of applying the colors.
If it's additive, then you start with black background, then start adding the colors. Eventually when you add all 3 main colors (Red, Green, Blue), you'll get blue. Also you'll get the 3 other combinations of these colors.

If it's subtractive, you start with white background. Then you remove the red color from it, hence getting cyan, then repeat the same thing for the other colors. Eventually when removing all main colors (Red, Green, Blue), you'll get black in the center.

You also get controls over the followings:
- Angle - the angle of the green/blue circles in degrees from the horizontal line going through the center of the red circle.
- Distance - the distance between the center of the red circle and the center of the green/blue circles.
- Intensity - the intensity of the colors. The higher the intensity, the stronger the color impact will be.
- Intensity drop effect - The higher the distance of that pixel from the center of its circle, the lower the intensity of the colors will be.
- Radius - the radius of the circles.
